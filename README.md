# SMS Classification Project: Spam vs. Ham

This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam" using a **Logistic Regression model** with **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer** for feature extraction. The objective is to develop a reliable and efficient classifier that accurately filters spam messages from legitimate ones.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
The preprocessing stage ensures the raw SMS text is transformed into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis and model training:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Remove or handle rows with missing values.
- **Text Cleaning**:
  - Remove punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
  - Normalize text to lowercase.
- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words (tokens).
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert the cleaned text into numerical features that reflect the importance of words in the dataset while reducing the weight of common but less informative words.

### 2. **Model Training**
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
  - **Why Logistic Regression?**
    - Simplicity and computational efficiency.
    - Effective for binary classification tasks.
    - Provides interpretable predictions as probabilities.
- **Training Process**:
  - Train the model on the features generated by the TF-IDF Vectorizer.
  - Learn the relationships between word importance and SMS labels (spam/ham).

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like:
- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified messages.
- **Precision**: Fraction of true spam messages among those predicted as spam.
- **Recall**: Fraction of actual spam messages correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall for balanced performance evaluation.
